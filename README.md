# Python OpenCV Face Recognition

## Introduction

Facial recognition is a method of recognizing or verifying a person's identification by looking at their face. People can be identified in pictures, films, or in real time using facial recognition technology.

Biometric security includes facial recognition. Voice recognition, fingerprint recognition, and ocular retina or iris recognition are all examples of biometric software. Although the technology is mostly utilized for security and law enforcement, there is growing interest in other applications.

## How to code Face Recognition with OpenCV

You might say that our mind can do these things easily but to actually code them into a computer is difficult? Don't worry, it is not. Thanks to OpenCV, coding face recognition is as easier as it feels.
- **Training Data Gathering:** Gather face data (face images in this case) of the persons you want to recognize
- **Training of Recognizer:** Feed that face data (and respective names of each face) to the face recognizer so that it can learn.
- **Recognition:** Feed new faces of the persons and see if the face recognizer you just trained recognizes them.

OpenCV comes equipped with built in face recognizer, all you have to do is feed it the face data. It's that simple and this how it will look once we are done coding it.
